This R script analyzes survey or test response data using Item Response Theory (IRT) models like the Rasch, Generalized Partial Credit Model (GPCM), and Graded Response Model (GRM). It first converts answers into numeric values, then calculates descriptive statistics (like the frequency of correct, incorrect, or unanswered responses). The script fits each model to the data and checks how well each item (question) fits the model using chi-square statistics. It also compares the models' performance, extracts item parameters, and estimates participants' ability scores (how well they did overall). Visualizations, like bar charts and ability score histograms, are created to help interpret the results.
